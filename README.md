# KinectToVR (Qt6 rewrite)

## KinectToVR API (w/ OpenVR driver)
KinectToVR provides simple to use driver and bindings for operating it, later called K2API.<br>
Thanks to it you can easily add and manage virtual trackers without writing your own OpenVR driver.<br>
For the quick (although descriptive) sample please see [this sample project](https://github.com/KinectToVR/k2vr-application/tree/master/docs/K2API_example).<br>
Everything is documented in ```KinectToVR_API.h``` header file, and [the wiki](https://github.com/KinectToVR/k2vr-application/wiki).<br>
Everything there, related to or connected with K2API has a ```K2API:``` prefix.<br>
If you're working in Unity/C#, ~~(or just hate KinectToVR)~~, please see [the VMT Project](https://github.com/gpsnmeajp/VirtualMotionTracker).

## Build instructions
0. Note: Repository may be chaotically updated, please check out<br>
repository before posting an issue with building or missing files.

1. Prerequisites
   - Visual Studio 2019 (Personally, I'm on VS2019 Preview, probably latest)
   - Kinect SDK 1.8 and 2.0 installed and visible in PATH<br>

   And if you're planning on building overlay projects:
   - Qt plugin for Visual Studio installed (Will be described later)
   - Qt 6.0.0 (Current) with all needed plugins

2. Set up the project
   - Take a deep breath and make yourself some coffee, <br>
   it's gonna take some time to set up all ```vcpkg``` packages.<br>
   (About 1-1.5 hour if you have 300-500mbps internet and a hdd)

   - Clone the latest OpenVR and Eigen3 into ```external/```:<br>
   ```git clone https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr external/openvr```<br>
   ```git clone https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen external/eigen```

   - Install ```vcpkg``` and its Visual Studio integration<br>
   ```git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git```<br>
   ```cd vcpkg```<br>
   ```./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh```<br>
   ```./vcpkg integrate install```

   - Install needed libraries (You should choose one linking method for all packages)<br>
   ```vcpkg install glm:x64-windows boost:x64-windows opencv3[world]:x64-windows cppzmq:x64-windows glog:x64-windows curlpp:x64-windows```<br>
   (Now you may rest a bit, also consider using a drive other than ```C:/```, it'll be about 6-7GB)

   - Install and setup Qt Visual Studio Tools (If you're planning on building overlay projects)
      + Download and install [for VS2019](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TheQtCompany.QtVisualStudioTools2019)

      + Add your Qt installation to the available installations list in Qt Visual Studio plugin<br>
      You have to search for msvc2019_64 folder<br><br>

      + Select Qt installation you've just added in each project properties (except driver and API projects)<br><br>

3. Build and deploy
   - Make sure you're building for x64 platform in release mode<br><br>
   ![](https://imgur.com/75ZXiqQ.png)

   - Click ```Build → build all``` and wait for the build to finish

   - All needed dlls from ```vcpkg``` should be automatically moved to deploy directory<br>
   (For general it's ```x64/Release/``` and for driver ```x64/Release/driver/```<br>
   You can find there KinectToVR driver fully set-up and ready to be registered.)<br>
   For the overlay app we'll need Qt modules - post build command will copy them automatically.<br>
   (```windeployqt``` command with correct arguments for both ```qml``` and output file will be run,<br>
   you will be able to find output log in deploy directory - possibly ```x64/Release/```<br>
   I've also decided to remove ```D3Dcompiler_47.dll```, since all it does for us is increasing CPU usage)

## Debugging OpenVR driver

1. Change run command in project properties, selecting your SteamVR installation path. <br>
(Must be the path to vrserver.exe file in current SteamVR installation directory) <br><br>

1. Remove driver dll from ```[K2Driver]/bin/win64``` and create a hard link:<br>
(```[K2Driver]``` stands for driver's deployment directory, it possibly is ```k2vr-application/x64/Release/driver/KinectToVR```)
   - Open cmd and navigate to ```OutDir``` <br>
   (Where you've built your binaries, possibly in ```x64/Release```)
   - Delete ```driver_KinectToVR.dll``` from ```[K2Driver]/bin/win64``` and keep the rest
   - Create a hard link: ```New-Item -ItemType HardLink -Name "[K2Driver]/bin/win64\driver_KinectToVR.dll" -Value driver_KinectToVR.dll``` where ```[K2Driver]``` possibly stands for ```./driver/KinectToVR```

1. Click on ```driver_KinectToVR``` project and select ```Debug→Start New Instance```<br>
You may turn on profiling tools (mostly for CPU) and experiment with the debugger right after.
